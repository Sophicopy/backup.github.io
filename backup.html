								In 2021, a woman in the body cream industry met me and she was worried because of her brand name was not sounding good and one of her clients wanted the name changed because of how it sounded.

								<br />

								<br />

								She almost lost the job because of her brand name if not because she took quick action and came to meet me for help.

								<br />

								After I heard and understood her, I asked her some questions and afterwards I and my graphic designer started brain storming, researching and creating different business name she could use.

								<br />

								<br />

								At the end of the day, we finally got a name that was not already taken and had a meaning. The name is Mavix Glow.

								<br />

								<br />

								The MA was taken from her traditional name,

								<br />

								The VIX was a tweaking of the word VIC- another part of her english name.

								<br />

								<br />

								The glow was used to show the agenda of the brand which was to help ladies get the glow of their skin back with Mavix Glow body cream.

										I loved creating stories like the one I used to read in my childhood, so I decided to start creating fictional stories and I called one of them "Eggie The MoneyMaster".

								<br />

								It is a story series that explains many hard business concepts and ideas using the main actor of the story - Eggie.

	After seven months of learning, writing and testing copy, I realized that I am more good at writing fictional stories used in copy than all other parts of copy.

								<br />

								<br />

								After this discovery, I changed my focus from an ordinary copywriter to a copywriter that creates fictional stories used in copy.

								The importance of a brand name can't be over-talked about.
								It what makes you able to recognise Pepsi by simply seeing the name and know its difference from Coca Cola.
