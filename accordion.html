      <div class="accordion">
      	
      	<!--start of first section-->
      	<div>
      		<input type="radio" name="QA_accordion" id="section-1" class="accordion-input">
      			<label for="section-1" class="accordion_label">What's the guarantee that you and the hosts will double my sales? And what will happen if you fail to do as you say?</label>
      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>The guarantee is we won't be using a method that's unknown and uncertain but the method of creating Grand Slam offers that have been known for success before.

Also I and the hosts have used this method before with success.

So the certain to happen part is that your sales will be doubled.

The unlikely part is that after the 30days, your sales don't increase nor double.

And if your sales aren't doubled after the 30 days challenge, you won't have to pay us anything and we will also give you the sales funnel we created for you in the challenge for free, to change to your desire.

When you calculate the worth of everything we'll be creating for you in this challenge, we have practically repaid your advertising budget 6X more. 

But we can guarantee that you'll get an increase of 25% and above in your sales.

All we need from you is a minimum advertising budget of 10,000 naira to pay for advertiment expenses and many others which when calculated is actually more than 10,000naira.

      		<div>
      		<input type="radio" name="QA_accordion" id="section-2" class="accordion-input">
      			<label for="section-2" class="accordion_label">If I don't have a digital product but a physical one, can I join?</label>
      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>No, the main people we are trying to help in this challenge are entrepreneurs with digital skills and products e.g course creators, graphic designers.

We might involve physical product owners in the future but currently it's a no.

      		<!--start of 3rd section-->
      		<div>
      		<input type="radio" name="QA_accordion" id="section-3" class="accordion-input">
      			<label for="section-3" class="accordion_label">Why can't the challenge be free?</label>
      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>The hosts invited to this challenge (including me) on a normal day charge between 10,000naira to 50,000naira to write a sales copy because of how good they are at their work.

But in this challange you'd be getting a sales copy, graphics, landing page design and a sales funnel for 10,000naira.

Would it be fair to us the hosts, if we get absolutely nothing but 10,000naira for helping five persons to double their sales in 30days?

Despite all the expenses, all the time, data and effort spent?

Even you don't work for free, your clients pay you in exchange for your work, then why should a challenge as great as this be free?

Also isn't it worth it to spend your advertising budget you were going to spend whether the DYS Challenge existed or not with greater results?

      		<!--start of 4th section-->
      		<div>
      		<input type="radio" name="QA_accordion" id="section-4" class="accordion-input">
      			<label for="section-4" class="accordion_label">I don't really understand the 40% commission and advertising budget thing you talked about earlier</label>
      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>The 40% is the amount of money I and the hosts will be paid if your sales are doubled, it will be calculated from the whole sales you earned during the challenge.

For example, let's say on average you earned 50,000naira when you advertised any of your digital products.

During the challenge, you then earn double which is 100,000naira.
We the hosts will get 40% of the 100,000naira which is:

40% of 100,000naira which would equal 40,000naira.

So we'll be paid 40,000naira</p>

      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>It's five people.
Yes, only 5. This should let you know how strict our method of choosing our special participants will be.
